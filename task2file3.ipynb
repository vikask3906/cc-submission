While here in the West it’s more common to style wide-leg pants with fitted tops, in Japan they keep everything rather loose. It’s not common for women to wear flat shoes to work, and three-plus-inch heels begin to stand out too much (which, contrary to New York fashion, is not desired). Absolutely no one is complaining when there are such cute options such as this bowtie slingback from Reformation or ridiculously comfy chunky heel from Vivaia—seriously, I saw at least ten people wearing this exact shoe.',\n",
